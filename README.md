# BJND *(Binocular Just-Noticeable-Difference)*

## Introduction
In recent years 3D technology has become popular and has reached more people, this technology offers to the viewers the feeling of immersion and depth experienced. It has been used as a result of the development of applications with enhancement of viewing experience such as movies or *games*, *space applications*, *flight simulators* and *robotic vision* among others.

## What are BJND Models?

*BJND* models are used for estimating the visibility threshold in which the **HVS** *(Human Visual System)*  cannot percieve changes in pixel values.
Until now the only BJND model has been developed by **Yin Zhao**, which depends of *background luminance*, *contrast*, and *edge regions*. 

You can find more information about the model in his paper:
